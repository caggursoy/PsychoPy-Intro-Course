# Part 3: Scripting a Basic Experiment in PsychoPy

## Practical Exercise

- **Guided tutorial on creating simple experiments**: Walk through the steps of creating a basic experiment using PsychoPy's Builder interface, which may include a simple reaction time task or a visual discrimination task. Explain the key components such as the timeline, stimuli, and response options.

- **Hands-on practice session**: Allow participants to apply what they've learned by creating their own basic experiments under supervision. Provide them with a set of objectives (e.g., create a study with two different stimuli types and collect responses), and let them experiment with different settings and options to familiarize themselves with the process.

### Example: Stroop Task!
