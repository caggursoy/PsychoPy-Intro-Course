# Part 2: Introduction to Psychopy (in an hour or so)

## Introduction to PsychoPy

- **Overview of PsychoPy and its capabilities**: The features and benefits of using PsychoPy for psychological experiments, including its graphical and scripting capabilities.

- **Installation and setup**: Process of downloading and installing PsychoPy. Include system requirements and troubleshooting common installation issues.

- **Interface overview**: A brief tour of the PsychoPy Builder and Coder interfaces, explaining the purpose and basic use of each.

## Optional: Experimental Design

- **Design principles and considerations**: Fundamentals of creating a sound experimental design, including the importance of hypothesis-driven experiments.

- **Randomization and counterbalancing**: Implementing randomization of trial orders and counterbalancing of conditions to minimize biases.

- **Control conditions and variables**: Defining control conditions and the importance of controlling variables to isolate causal effects.

## Stimulus Presentation

- **Creating and presenting stimuli**: Introduction to the types of stimuli that can be created in PsychoPy (text, images, sounds, videos) and how to present them sequentially or based on conditions.

- **Timing controls and synchronization**: How to control the timing of stimulus presentation and synchronizing it accurately with experimental requirements.

- **Response collection**: Overview of methods for collecting participant responses, including keyboard, mouse, and other devices.

## Data Collection

- **Logging data**: How to log experimental data effectively, covering file formats and data structure for easy analysis.

- **Response collection methods**: Different methods for collecting responses in PsychoPy and how to implement them.

- **Synchronization with external devices**: How to integrate PsychoPy with external hardware like EEG or eye trackers for advanced experimental setups.
